This is a AU plugin prject based on JUCE. It builds an artifact that can be loaded into an AU-compatible host such as Logic Pro.

The project uses CMakeLists.txt as the build file. Sources are in the `source/` directory. FUSE is added as a Git submodule in `extern/`.

More information about the project is available in README.md.
